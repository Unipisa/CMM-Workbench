# CMM Workbench

### This [SWHAPPE](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE) workbench is for the acquisition of the source code of CMM, a Customisable Memory Manager.

-------------------

This repository contains information on the acquisition process related to the CMM project that were created during the work.

The original finds are stored in the [Depository](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM-Depository) containing the [raw materials](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM-Depository/tree/master/raw_materials) and the [browsable source](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM-Depository/tree/master/browsable_source).

The resulting 
[development history](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM/tree/SourceCode/) can be found in the [CMM repository](https://github.com/Unipisa/CMM).

This repository was created with the support of the [Software Heritage Acquisition Process Pisa Enactor](https://github.com/Unipisa/SWHAPPE).
