# CMM moments - a first attempt

*Disclaimer: Here is an incomplete proposal of items and related information to upload to Wikimedia for CMM. I am not sure I understand well enough how things work. So, please bear with me and send me comments, tips, etc. on how to keep on the right track.

Here and there I have also put some of my doubts, in italic: You can find them searching for "Question".*

### Conventions

Wikidata items to be created (to the best of my knowlegde) are identified as Q*xxx.

In the statements, I use braces to pair the name and value of a property. The same for the fields of an uploaded image or video, iFrames, etc.
